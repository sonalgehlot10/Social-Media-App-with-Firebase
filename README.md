**Live Project:** [https://social-media-app-e5f82.web.app/](https://social-media-app-e5f82.web.app/)

## Overview
This project is a **social media web application** where users can sign up, create posts, and interact through a simple, clean interface.  
It’s powered entirely by **Firebase**, handling authentication, storage, and real-time data updates.  

I built this project to explore how real-time apps work and to strengthen my understanding of **React + TypeScript integration** and **Firebase services**.

---

## Inspiration
This project aimed to **practice building a complete, deployable web app**, not just isolated components.  
I wanted to understand how front-end and backend logic come together in real time using Firebase’s tools for auth, storage, and database management.  
A social media platform felt like the perfect use case to apply these concepts since it involves user sessions, data relationships, and dynamic rendering, all key parts of full-stack development.

## Tech Stack
**Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite  
**Backend / Database:** Firebase (Firestore, Authentication, Storage)  
**Hosting:** Firebase Hosting  
**State Management:** React Hooks  
**Styling:** CSS / Tailwind (if used)

---

## Features
- User authentication (sign up / login / logout)  
- Create and delete posts in real time  
- Store user data and images in Firebase  
- Responsive layout across desktop and mobile  
- Deployed live with Firebase Hosting

## What I Learned
- Setting up and integrating **Firebase Authentication** and **Firestore Database**  
- Handling **real-time updates** and asynchronous operations in React  
- Using **TypeScript** with React for cleaner, type-safe code  
- Deploying production-ready web apps directly to Firebase  
- Structuring React components and managing state efficiently  

This project helped me connect my understanding of front-end frameworks with cloud-based backend services, giving me practical experience with **real-time apps** and deployment pipelines.
